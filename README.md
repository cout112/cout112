- 👋 Hi, I’m @cout112
- 👀 I’m interested in Blockchain development and data science. Python is my language of choice, although I use others such as SQL or JavaScript, HTML and CSS to do front-end web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning artificial intelligence since I have been a data analyst for 2 years now and I want to get into data science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any source project that involves finance analysis.
